    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>This is primarily my technical blog, but you will see some
nontechnical ones under the label <code>random-thoughts</code>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really like posting very personal things online. But if you
want to know me, just send me an email. I will be more than happy to
respond to it.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Here are some quick facts:</em></strong></h4>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science
at UCLA.</p>

<p>Emacs is my editor of choice.</p>

<p>Python is my goto language.</p>

<p>I enjoy solving problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">project euler</a>.
Here is my project euler profile</p>

<p><img src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/yangxinyu.png" alt="my project euler profile"></p>

<p>I am a fan of functional programming languages, but I don&#39;t get much
chance writing in them.</p>

<p>I maintain a <a href="/preferences">history of preferences</a>
(CS related) as they change over time.
Since I still fairly young, both options of the above categories are
open to me. Hopefully, it would be of interest to both readers and
the future me.</p>

<p>I remember someone (whom I couldn&#39;t recall) once said that he
could tell personality from a person&#39;s emacs configuration.
Here is my <a href="https://github.com/colinxy/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>
(mostly emacs configuration) if you want to check it out.</p>

<p>I enjoy <a href="https://digitalocean.com">digitalocean</a> for cloud hosting.
Here is <a href="https://m.do.co/c/4604523c7997">my referal link</a> if you want to
get $10 for free.</p>

<p>My favorite joke is
<a href="https://twitter.com/nixcraft/statuses/774612618547834880">this piece from nixCraft</a>.
You would get to know why if you have read
<a href="/devops/2016/09/02/first-time-screwing-up-remote-server.html">this post</a>.</p>

<h1>About the Blog</h1>

<p>This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
write simple markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as
fully featured as HTML as it trades features for simplicity.</p>

<p>As this blog is my very first attempt at blogging, I could experiment
a lot of things on this blog without notifying anyone; for example, a
permanent link that worked today might break tomorrow. I am really
sorry for the inconvience caused.</p>

<p></br></p>

<h1>About the Title</h1>

<p>I am a fan of functional programming languages. However, the state of
software engineering is constant change, no matter how we envision it
to be.</p>
