About Me
========

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science.

I enjoy solving problems on [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Here is my project euler profile

I maintain a [history of preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences)
as they change over time.
Since I still fairly young, both options of the above categories are
open to me. Hopefully, it would be of interest to both readers and
the future me.

I remember someone (whom I couldn't recall) once said that he
could tell personality from a person's emacs configuration.
So is the case in choice of software or programming languages.

I enjoy [digitalocean](https://digitalocean.com) for cloud hosting.
Here is [my referal link](https://m.do.co/c/4604523c7997) if you want to
get $10 for free.

About the Blog
==============

This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
write simple markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as
fully featured as HTML as it trades features for simplicity.

As this blog is my very first attempt at blogging, I could experiment
a lot of things on this blog without notifying anyone; for example, a
permanent link that worked today might break tomorrow. I am really
sorry for the inconvience caused.

About the Title
==============

I am a fan of functional programming languages. However, the state of
software engineering is constant change, no matter how we envision it
to be.
