About Me
========

This is primarily my technical blog, but you will see some
nontechnical ones under the label `random-thoughts`.

I don't really like posting very personal things online. But if you
want to know me, just send me an email. I will be more than happy to
respond to it.

#### ***Here are some quick facts:***

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science
at UCLA.

Emacs is my editor of choice.

Python is my goto language.

I enjoy solving problems on [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Here is my project euler profile

I am a fan of functional programming languages, but I don't get much
chance writing in them.

I maintain a [history of preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences)
(CS related) as they change over time.
Since I still fairly young, both options of the above categories are
open to me. Hopefully, it would be of interest to both readers and
the future me.

I remember someone (whom I couldn't recall) once said that he
could tell personality from a person's emacs configuration.
Here is my [dotfiles](https://github.com/colinxy/dotfiles)
(mostly emacs configuration) if you want to check it out.

I enjoy [digitalocean](https://digitalocean.com) for cloud hosting.
Here is [my referal link](https://m.do.co/c/4604523c7997) if you want to
get $10 for free.

My favorite joke is
[this piece from nixCraft](https://twitter.com/nixcraft/statuses/774612618547834880).
You would get to know why if you have read

About the Blog
==============

This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
write simple markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as
fully featured as HTML as it trades features for simplicity.

As this blog is my very first attempt at blogging, I could experiment
a lot of things on this blog without notifying anyone; for example, a
permanent link that worked today might break tomorrow. I am really
sorry for the inconvience caused.

About the Title

The world is functional while I am not.
