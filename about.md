About Me
========

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science.

Here are a few of my preferences to give you an idea of who I am:

- I prefer Python to Javascipt.
- I prefer C++ to Java.
- I prefer emacs to vim.

Since I still fairly young, both options of the above categories are
open to me. I would like to maintain a [history]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences)
of how my preferences change over time. Hopefully, it would be
of interest to both readers and the future me.

About the Blog
==============

This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
write simple markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as
fully featured as HTML as it trades many features for simplicity.
For example, when you click on a link inside my blog post (not the
links on the footer), it will open in the same page, which is
particularly annoying to me. So, use right-click or ctrl-click and
open link in new tab if you like.
