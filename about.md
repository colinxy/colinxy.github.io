About Me
========

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science.
As you would suppose, my blog will be a little technical.


About the Blog
==============

This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
simply write markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as 
fully featured as HTML as it trades many features for simplicity.
For example, when you click on a link inside my blog post (not the links
on the footer), it will open in the same page, which is particularly annoying to me.
So, use right-click or ctrl-click and open link in new tab if you like.
