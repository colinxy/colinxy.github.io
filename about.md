About Me
========

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science.

I enjoy solving problems on [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Here is my project euler profile

I maintain a [history of preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences)
as they change over time.
Since I still fairly young, both options of the above categories are
open to me. Hopefully, it would be of interest to both readers and
the future me.

I remember someone (whom I couldn't recall) once said that he
could tell personality from a person's emacs configuration.
So is the case in choice of software or programming languages.

About the Blog
==============

This blog is powered by Jekyll on Github pages, which means I can
write simple markdown for my blog posts. But markdown is not as
fully featured as HTML as it trades many features for simplicity.
For example, when you click on a link inside my blog post (not the
links on the footer), it will open in the same page, which is
particularly annoying to me. So, use right-click or ctrl-click and
open link in new tab if you like.
