Here I maintain a list of my preferences as they changes over time.


### 2016-01-30

- I prefer Python to Javascipt.
- I prefer C++ to Java.
- I prefer emacs to vim.

### 2016-04-11

Maybe it has not been long enough for any changes to happen,
but I am adding new stuff to this list.

- common lisp: cool functional paradigm, with support for imperative style.
  Hopefully it will be my new favorite alongside python.
- I still consider javascript worthless my time even though I have
  coded a project in it.
