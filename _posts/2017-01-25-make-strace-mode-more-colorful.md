*This post will be updated with more information on strace-mode (with
snapshot) and emacs font-lock*

Just made my first pull request to a open source project! Hopefully my
pull request will be accepted.

Strace-mode is a emacs major mode for syntax highlighting output from
`strace` command on linux. You can download the package from melpa,
also checkout the repo [here](https://github.com/pkmoore/strace-mode).
