Since pointers are about to be covered in my computer science class,
I would make a post about it, both for my own review, and for your reference.
I will not try to make a comprehensive introduction to pointer, but I will make
this post comparison based, so you can see how concepts are related by yourself.

Because pointer is a very important and complex feature in C/C++, my post may be incomplete or inaccurate,
please feel free to point it out.
I researched on the following reference before writing my post

- *The C Programming Language*, by Dennis Ritchie, the father of the C language, and Brian Kernighan,
- *Absolute C++*, by Walter Savitch, the recommended reading for my class,
- wikipedia
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/)
- [cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [This article on pointers](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/106/)

<!--
Most modern programming languages, like Java or Python, have abandoned the use of pointers,
which when abused, can cause catastrophic consequences. They instead make use of
reference, which makes no difference between the reference itself and the variable obtained from dereference.
-->

### Pointers

Pointer is simply something that points to a variable. In computer memory, this is
the memory address of the variable.

```c++
int *ptr;
int int_var = 1;
ptr = &int_var;    // assign the address of int_var to ptr
```
```
computer memory
                    +--------+                +-----------+
                    |        |   points to    |           |
                    |   ptr ----------------> |  int_var  |
                    |        |                |           |
                    +--------+                +-----------+

memory address:       0xABCD                      0xBCDE
value:                0xBCDE                      1 (int)
```

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of the variable it points to.
We can get the address of a variable with the _addressof_ operator **&**, and get the value of the
variable it points to with the _dereferencing_ operator **\*** . Dereferencing an
uninitialized pointer will crash the program.

```c++
int *ptr;
int int_var = 1;
ptr = &int_var;    // assign the address of int_var to ptr
std::cout << "the value of the variable the pointer points to: "
          << *ptr  // dereference ptr: get the value of the variable ptr points to
          << std::endl;
std::cout << "the value of the pointer, an address: "
          << ptr   // get the value of ptr
          << std::endl;
std::cout << "the address of the pointer stored in memory: "
          << &ptr  // get the address of ptr
          << std::endl;

int *uninit_ptr;
std::cout << "Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer"
          << "will crash the program"
          << *uninit_ptr  // dereference the pointer
          << std::endl;
```

In a 64-bit architecture, the size of a pointer
is 8 bytes, and for a 32-bit architecture, it is 4 bytes. The size of the pointer
is irrelevant to the size of the variable it points to. You can get the size of pointer
with `sizeof` function.

```c++
int *int_ptr;
double *double_ptr;
int int_ptr_size = sizeof(int_ptr),
    double_ptr_size = sizeof(double_ptr);  // should be size_t, but I will use int for simplicity

std::cout << "size of int_ptr: " << int_ptr_size << std::endl
std::cout << "size of double_ptr: " << double_ptr_size << std::endl;

std::cout << "the size of a pointer that points to an int and " <<
             "the size of a pointer that points to a double are " <<
             ((int_ptr_size == double_ptr_size) ? "the same!" : "different!" )
          << std::endl;
```

The `sizeof` function (can also be used as a statement) returns the size in bytes of
the variable in memory. For example, `sizeof(int)` would return 4
and `sizeof(double)` would return 8 on most modern computers. I will talk more
about sizeof function later in the distinction between pointers and arrays.


### Pointer Arithmetic
```c++
#include <cassert>
int a[10];
int *p = a + 5;
int *a_4_ptr = a + 4, *a_6_ptr = a + 6;

assert(p - 1 == a_4_ptr && p + 1 == a_6_ptr);
```
```
consecutive chunks of memory

    +------+------+------+
    | a[4] | a[5] | a[6] |
    +------+------+------+
    ↑      ↑      ↑
    p-1    p      p+1

```

When you increment a pointer by 1, the value stored inside the pointer is incremented
by the size of the type that the pointer points to, and in this case, `sizeof(int)`.

```c++
#include <cassert>
int a[10];
int *a_4_ptr = a + 4, *a_6_ptr = a + 6;

assert(a_6_ptr - a_4_ptr == 2);
```
```
consecutive chunks of memory

    +------+------+------+
    | a[4] | a[5] | a[6] |
    +------+------+------+
    ↑             ↑
    a_4_ptr       a_6_ptr

pointer subtraction produce the difference in elements between the elements
```

The difference between a_4_ptr and a_6_ptr is `2 * sizeof(int)`,
but the subtraction between pointers pointing to the same type produce
the difference in elements between the elements.

<!--
Pointer arithmetic works on the following situations

- Comparison between pointers
  - comparison make sense when two pointers point to members of the same array
- Addition and subtraction of integers on a pointer
- Subtraction of a pointer to another pointer of the members of the same array
-->

    *The C Programming Language* by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, for a more detailed explanation

### Pointers and Arrays

```c++
int a[5];
```
```
consecutive chunks of memory

    +------+------+------+------+------+
    | a[0] | a[1] | a[2] | a[3] | a[4] |
    +------+------+------+------+------+
    ↑
    a

array a is actually the address of the first element
of the array.
```
```c++
#include <cassert>
assert(a[0] == * a);
assert(&a[0] == a);
```

Initializing a character array with a string literal is equivalent to
initializing with a list.

```c++
char charArray[] = "hello";
char charArray[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
```

Notice the array end with the character **'\0'**, which is the terminator for C strings.

When we try to get the length of the string with strlen function from cstring library,
it will return the length of the character array before the first **'\0'** character.
But when we try to get the length of the character array with `sizeof(charArray) / sizeof(char)`,
it will return the size of the array represented in memory, which includes the
**'\0'** character.

```c++
#include <cstring>
std::cout << strlen(charArray) << std::endl;
// prints 5
std::cout << sizeof(charArray) / sizeof(char) << std::endl;
// prints 6
```

Array works like pointers in that you can do pointer arithmetic and dereference.
But you cannot reassign arrays.

```c++
const int arraySize = 5;
int array[arraySize] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
    std::cout << * (array+i)  // equivalent to array[i]
              << std::endl;
}

// won't work. DOES NOT COMPILE
for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
    std::cout << * (array++)
              << std::endl;
}

// This works, because arrayPtr is a pointer
int *arrayPtr = array;
for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
    std::cout << * (arrayPtr++)
              << std::endl;
}
```

The `sizeof` function works differently for pointers and arrays.
You can no longer get the size of the string literal stored in memory with function `sizeof`.
You can only get the size of the pointer itself,
which is either 4 bytes or 8 bytes depending on your architecture.

```c++
const char *charPtr = "hello";
```
```c++
std::cout << strlen(charPtr) << std::endl;
// returns 5, the length of the string
std::cout << sizeof(charPtr) << std::endl;
// returns the size of the pointer in bytes
```

Arrays are not allowed as a parameter of a function, or as a return value of a function.
Actually When you pass an array into a function, the array is automatically casted to pointer,
The following function will not work. as it will always return the size of pointer divided by the size of int.

```c++
int getArraySize(int array[]) {
    return sizeof(array) / sizeof(int);
    // will always return the size of pointer divided by the size of int
}
```
