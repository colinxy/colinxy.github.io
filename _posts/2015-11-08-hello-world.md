After so much hassle, I finally got my blog up and running,
but I didn't have the triumphant feeling for someone who has achieved
something. The general layout looks pretty, and the overall feeling is
good; one thing that's missing is originality.

I have been tweaking with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the engine that powers this blog, for
the entire day, without using its default layout as it looks like now.
But to no avail. Some error like the one below kept bugging me.

```
jekyll 2.4.0 | Error:  wrong argument type nil (expected String)
```

When I was running it on Jekyll 3.0, it was working fine, but some plugin
requires Jekyll 2.4. I didn't know any Ruby and had no idea where to start from.
In the end, I admitted defeat. I accepted the default layout scheme and
kept on blogging. This is nothing uncommon in software engineering,
dependency hell is always around, at least it won't disappear until I gain
a good understanding of the operating system and the underlying software.
(This might be an interesting example of NULL pointer exception)

So, I start blogging.
